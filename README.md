# Pharmacy Management System â€“ MVP

A proof-of-concept web application built for a university project.  
The goal was to model key pharmacy workflowsâ€”patients, doctors,
medicines, and appointment bookingâ€”while sharpening Laravel skills and
practising clean project structure.

| **Appointment Booking** | Patients choose a doctor **+** date & time. |
| **Activity Logs** | Every critical action is written to a log table; admins can audit all events from the dashboard. |
| **REST-friendly Architecture** | Route / Controller / Model split with Eloquent ORM for tidy, testable code. |

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Laravel** â€“ PHP framework & Eloquent ORM  
- **MySQL** â€“ relational database  
- **HTML / CSS** â€“ Blade templates and a pre-built admin theme  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** â€“ dashboard interactions
